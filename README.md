## Why?

Knowledge is the true wealth of humanity. If it weren't for our
ancestors, who chose to pass down their knowledge and experiences, we
would still be a primitive species. Whatever advancement that we as
a species have achieved is because we chose to share information.

To put a paywall on knowledge like that is both obscene and goes against
the very nature of humanity.

It is possible to run a sustainable publication business while still
respecting freedom. [LWN.net](https://lwn.net) is one of my favourite
publications that has been around forever. So it is possible. I hope
medium.com comes up with other, non-harmful ways to run a sustainable
business.
